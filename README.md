# microdrive
Microdrive designs for silicon probes 

The .stl files are optimized for Asiga Pico2 HD with NextDent Model.
For other printers and/or resins, some adjustment may be needed.

The drive is designed for a 1/2-inch 00-90 screw and a metal pole taken from a post terminal strip.
The attachment is intended to be used with 3/8-inch 00-90 screws.  
To build the variangle attachment, 1/4-inch 000-120 screws and nuts are also needed.

The original idea of the drive is described in the following paper.
