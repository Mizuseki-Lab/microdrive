## how to implant the probe (demo with a mock)
1. position the drive on a stereotaxic frame

2. Fix the drive on the skull (with dental cement)

3. remove attachment from the holder

4. de-solder the connector and secure it wherever you want

5. remove the holder from the drive

## how to recover the drive
1. set the skull on a stereotaxic frame (after perfusion)  
2. put the holder back on the drive  
3. align the attachment (holes on the holder and screws on the attachment can be used as markers)  
4. connect the attachment on the holder  
5. (optional) move up the arms by truning screws  
6. remove a screw connecting the drive on the base  
7. slowly move up the drive with stereotaxic arm  

## how the variangle attachment works
when the screws are loose, the angles can be changed  
[video showing variangle attachment (screws are loose)](variangle.mp4)

when all 3 screws are pushing the bottom plate, the angle is fixed.  

One extreme angle

Another extreme angle (the same attachment but different screw positioning)

The .stl files are optimized for Asiga Pico2 HD with NextDent Model.
For other printers and/or resins, some adjustment may be needed.

The drive is designed for a 1/2-inche 00-90 screw and a metal pole taken from a post terminal strip.
The attachment is intended to be used with 3/8-inche 00-90 screws.

The original idea of the drive is described in the following paper.
